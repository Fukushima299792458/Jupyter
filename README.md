## Supervised Learning

Supervised learning is a kind of machine learning characterised by its required input and "supervision" i.e. supervised learning is for making predictions based on already labeled data. Supervised machine learning uses prerecorded data and extrapolates that to predict how it will change. This is often used in applications like weather forecasting or other cases where we want to predict the future.

## Unsupervised Learning

Unlike supervised learning, unsupervised learning isn't given a pattern to learn but a pattern to find. Unsupervised learning algorithms are designed to find the patterns, divisions, and groups within a data set and label them. This can help to find distinct groups in, for example, flower species.

## Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning is a kind of machine learning that learns based on experience or interaction with a complex environment e.g. trial and error or evolution. Similar to evolution, many different agents will be randomly generated and only the best will be kept and randomly mutated for the next generation.

### Deep Learning

Deep learning (no demonstration included) is a subset of reinforcement learning but can develop much more complex behaviours than other reinforcement learning techniques. Generally, deep learning programs aim to mimic biological brains by mathematically simulating neurons. This allows for much more emergent complexity and AI that can respond to its environment by taking live sensory inputs to generate its outputs.
